# SimpReactor

Chemical reactor design software is completely theoretical for simulating elementary reactions, drawing elementary and somewhat complete diagrams, and other parameters required for a general simulation.

## Specification

- [SPEC-1: Hybrid Reactor Modeling Workbench](docs/SPEC-1-Hybrid-Reactor-Modeling-Workbench.md)

## Development

Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

Run the CSTR demo CLI:

```bash
simpreactor cstr-demo --duration 200 --points 200
